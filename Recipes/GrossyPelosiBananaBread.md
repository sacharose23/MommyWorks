### Instructions

1. Preheat oven 365 degrees (350 sea level)..
2. In a large bowl, roughly mix granulated sugar, brown sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract. 
3. Add eggs and mashed bananas. Combine. 
4. Mix in all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. 
5. Optional: chop chocolate bar and add in or add in chocolate chips.
6. Oil loaf pan and line it with sheet of parchment so that there are extra flaps over the long side of the pan. Easier to pull out the loaf.
7. Pour batter into loaf pan, spreading it evenly. 
8. Place in oven for 60 minutes (sea level 50-60 minutes) or until a knife comes cleanly out of the bread. 
9. Remove from oven and let cool.

### Notes

* Other Baking Dishes: This recipe can be made in a 9x9 inch pan or in muffin/cupcake tins. Both will require shorter bake times than the loaf pan, so keep an eye on the oven and stop when your testing knife comes out cleanly!
* Storing: Airtight container or bag to keep it fresh. 
* Freezing: Freeze unfrosted tightly wrapped to avoid freezer burn. To defrost, leave on the counter top overnight and then frost. 
* Meals: Breakfast or Dessert
