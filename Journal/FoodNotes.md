# Food Notes

## Past meal fails:

* Kai didn't like chickpea veggie nuggets at all, but Rose didn't mind it. (https://thenaturalnurturer.com/chickpea-vegetable-nuggets/#recipe)
* Kids tend to not like any creamy pastas...or pastas at all...bummer. They don't mind asian noodle dishes (https://www.yummytoddlerfood.com/creamy-pasta-with-broccoli/#wprm-recipe-container-6801)
* Kids don't really like quesadillas.
* Kids don't like sweet potato or root veggies in general.
* Rose randomly liked arugula with honey dijon dressing.
