I'm sitting in a Starbucks in the village at Northstar. Jon is on the mountain snowboarding. "Is this sweet?" I ask referencing the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha. "Not really, it has 3 pumps." Whatever that means. I take a sip, it's definitely way too sweet. Abi, one of the other baristas, was nice enough to remake it. I requested 50% less sweetner and surprisingly, it's just on that cusp of too sweet, but drinkable. I'm a black coffee kind of girl, so I should have known better. Then again I avoid Starbucks like the plague. But, I needed somewhere to write. 

Writing...I don't ever really do it. It's more of my husband's thing. But, I'm going to try for a bit. I heard it's therapeutic. 

Mostly why I don't write is because my mind runs a thousand miles an hour with countless thoughts in countless categories of my life. Life is overwhelming now. Probably the most complex it's ever been, but I guess that's expected. At every life stage, you just add more and more layers to it. You collect more things and to make it seem less complex you get rid of physical things first. A purge or a cleanse. That's what people do when life seems too overwhelming. I don't believe it reduces complexity. Only it makes your environment more orderly and less cluttered so that you can survive the current complexity. 

What am I talking about? 

Well, the top of mind thing for me is motherhood. I graduated myself to motherhood. An active choice. But, I didn't realize that taking on that identity would be challenging in the fact that I had to also keep my other identities intact. If I want to survive and thrive that is.

I'm supposed to be skiing right now actually. But, last night I messed up my tailbone from holding my napping daughter while Kerry stopped by to catch up and discuss our potential business relationship. Yup, this would have been my first day ever skiing. I've snowboaded before, but, in general, have not been on the snowy slopes in maybe 2 or 3 years. Last year, I had a newborn. The year before that I was pregnant. 

When you make a decision to have kids there are a few things you have to adjust. Adjustments that last years. That kind of commitment does not really exist elsewhere. Jon likes to say "Kids don't make your life boring. It's your choice." He says bold, much too simple statements like that sometimes. Statements that tends to piss people off because they're not 100% true and usually very controversial. But, he loves getting under people's skin. He likes to think that making people uncomfortable helps them grow...or whatever. I'm the opposite. There are only a few things that I believe in just as passionately. Usually they're not controversial. Unless it's oxford commas, which I can see myself going into a fist fight over. (the answer is yes I use Oxford commas, and if you don't, you should rethink your life.)

There are lots of kids here, which makes me miss my kids. They're with Jennifer back in Reno probably having a great time. 

I've been rethinking my career role this year. January I experienced burnout with my work. It was probably the first time in my life that I had passive suicidial thoughts. I define it that way because that's what a therapist called it yesterday. Basically, I was so overwhelmed with life, mostly due to frustrations with work, but also with sicknesses, winter, no childcare, etc. that I got into a deep depression and had thoughts like running away or just not being where I was in the moment. I don't know. Suicide sounds extreme, but I definitely had thoughts about me jumping in front of a bus during that month. Obviously, it was a red flag and I acted very quickly. I told Jon and we devised a plan. If things did not get any better at my work by St. Patrick's Day (random, I know), I would put in my two weeks notice even if I did not have a back-up job. Just agreeing to that plan melted most of my anxiety and depression. I had hope.

Things did not change, but I hung on because other parts of my life were getting somewhat better. In the end, I did end up quitting and July 1st was my last day. At that time, Jon offered me a role as General Manager of Storm Cloud Development (SCD). SCD was his company established 2013. It's been many different things over the years. At this point, it was basically a "dev shop". We consult and we build things through contracts. Jon was working a full-time contract gig with Nintendo through SCD. I took over SCD operations, specifically to develop and bring to market FundedReport, a data product that sounded boring at the start, but I'm pretty amped about it now. During the summer, I learned a lot of things starting my entrepreneurial role. I was doing great, but then sort of had a change of heart in the arrangement.

I realized that I really did not want to work so much during this time in my life. I have a 3 year old son, Kai, and a one year old daughter, Rose. They are so freaking adorable. It's not just me. Everyone thinks so. I never ever thought it would be possible that I would want to be a stay-at-home mom. The concept was not even on my radar because I grew up with a single, full-time employed mom, who was fiercely independent. My mom's the type of person that most of how she lives is how everyone should live. So, being an independent woman, most importantly, a financially independent woman was really the only way. 

I never minded that lifestyle, but thankfully, I'm in a very secure and supported position to be able to be a stay-at-home mom, if I choose. Any choice you make in life has some level of risk. I did not decide on this path lightly. Jon and I have spent months thinking, talking, and designing an arrangement that works for me...or I should say, us.

Since I've started transitioning to more of a stay-at-home mom role, so many things in my life have gotten better, specifically my health. My anxiety has decrease, my mood has increased, and my body physically felt better. Not much change in libido...yet. We believe it's important to track these things, more formally called key performance indicators, or KPIs. 

With any venture, you should start with goals. Why did I want to become a stay-at-home mom? 

Side note: I don't really like that term: stay-at-home. I think it's pretty outdated now that COVID happened and many jobs have become remote. And most stay-at-home moms I know hustle with side gigs. Jon and I have tried coming up with better terms. 

We did a little experiment when I proposed the idea of SAHM. We, separately, outlined the requirements documentation, basically how we envisioned this new role. When we came together, our documents were very similar! It's awesome that we were on the same page. This role is truly many roles in one:

1. Caretaker
2. Educator
3. Homemaker
4. Trophy Wife (let me explain this one)

Caretaker was top priority - making sure the kids were safe and healthy. Educator was my idea. Since I had all this experience in education (nearly 10 years), it would be a shame not to use it for the best reason possible, my children. Homemaker was a bonus. I hate how there's hardly any order in our house. There are so many todos and ideas in making our fixer-upper *feel* like home. This opportunity would hopefully give me the time to knock those out. The last one was a term my husband suggested. Some of my requirements fit under how he defined the term, though I never gave mine a label, just a requirement. I required that I get the time to invest in my physical wellbeing since this role is very demanding in every way I needed the energy and stamina to keep up. I required that I attend yoga twice a week and ju-jitsu twice a week (ju-jitsu was really inspired by my anxiety). 

All very ambitious, I know.
