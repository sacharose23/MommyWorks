### Materials

- Contact paper
- Black construction paper
- Green tissue paper in various shades
- Scissors
- Glue stick
- Colorful plastic gems

### Instructions

- Sketch and cut out the shape of a Christmas tree onto black construction paper.
- Cut out the trees. Once your outline is cut, you will need to poke a small hole inside the tree and cut inward to make a half inch thick border.
- Using the tree outlines, I traced a second set to adhere to the back side of the sun catcher. Depending on the size of your tree, you could also opt to simply fold the construction paper in half and then cut once.
- Prepare the tissue paper by tearing the green paper into small squares.
- Once your paper is prepared, provide two sheets of clear contact paper for each child. We cut our contact paper sheets to be slightly larger than the size of our trees.
- Remove the backing of one of the sheets and tape it down to a work space with the sticky side up. We suggest taping down part of the contact paper first, then peeling it off.
- Place your black tree border on top of the contact paper first. This provides a nice outline for the placement of the tissue paper.
- Begin arranging the different hues of green tissue squares onto the contact paper.
- Once the tissue paper has covered the inside of the tree, grab some glue and place the second tree outline on top.
- Next, carefully adhere the second layer of contact paper on top to seal it. You will want to do this sticky side down so that the tissue will be completely covered.
- Cut the excess contact paper off and decorate your tree with jeweled “ornaments.”
- Choose a sunny spot to hang them so that they could be admired throughout the holiday season!
